Plug'n'Play ► it should properly forward the NODE_OPTIONS environment variable
    Since ESM loaders are in a separate thread, they run `-r` on their own and
    asynchronously. As a result an additional `42` is printed after the main
    process exits when the ESM loader is enabled, which is always the case on zpm.

Features ► Resolutions ► it should support overriding a packages with another, but only if it originally resolved to a specific reference
    This test, despite its name, doesn't actually checks that we only overrides
    a specific resolved version. Instead, it checks that we only overrides a
    specific _exact original range_. This capability is removed as it's both
    confusing and quite useless.

Plug'n'Play API ► std - v1 ► getPackageInformation ► it should return the package dependencies
    The test is actually wrong; it thinks we should only return no-deps as
    dependency, but it forgot that the root-workspace self-dependency should
    also be listed.

Plugins ► typescript ► Adding types ► it should reuse ranges when adding @types if the ranges of the original descriptor match (nested workspaces)
    We don't support "Nested workspaces" anymore (ie having a `workspaces` field inside multiple
    package.json files in the same project; it now has to be at the root).
